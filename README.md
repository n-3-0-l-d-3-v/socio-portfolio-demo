## My Solo Contributions
I independently designed and developed the complete system:

- **Backend APIs (Express.js)**: Designed REST APIs for events, registrations, and participants.  
- **Database Schema**: Structured relational data in Supabase (events, users, registrations).  
- **Admin Tools**: Added Excel import/export (exceljs) and file upload (multer).  
- **Automation**: Implemented scheduled tasks with node-cron.  
- **UI/UX**: Added GSAP animations and Tailwind styling for modern look & feel.
